        JS High-level overview
      </h1>
      <div class="article">
        <div class="article__text-box u-margin-btm-lrg">
          <h2 class="heading-secondary--topics u-margin-btm-sml">High level</h2>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            In any other low level programming language you have to manually
            manage the memory resources. for example you have to ask the computer
            for memory space to create a new <strong>Variable</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            However with <strong>High level</strong> programming languages like
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> or <strong>Python</strong> we don't have
            to manage resources at all because of the so called abstractions in
            these languages, it takes all that work away from us.
          </p>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            The downside of these <strong>High level</strong> programming
            languages is that our applications wont be as optimized and fast as
            the applications made with <strong>Low level languages</strong>

          <h2 class="heading-secondary--topics u-margin-btm-sml">Garbage collected</h2>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            One of the powerful tools that takes away memory management from us developers is <strong>Garbage Collection</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            It's an algorithm that runs in <strong>JavaScript</strong> engine, which then removes
            the old and unused <strong>Objects</strong> from the computer memory. This then allows us optimize our program <strong>automatically</strong>.
          </p>

        <div class="article__text-box u-margin-btm-lrg">
          <h2 class="heading-secondary--topics u-margin-btm-sml">Multi paradigm</h2>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            <strong>Paradigm</strong> is an approach and mindset of <strong>Structuring code</strong>. In short its our <strong>Style and Technique</strong> of writing code.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            There are 3 types of <strong>Paradigm</strong> in <strong>JavaScript</strong>:
          </p>


          <ul class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            <li>procedural programming</li>
            <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</li>
            <li>Functional programming (FP)</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            <strong>procedural programming</strong> is Structuring our code in a <strong>linear fashion</strong> with some <strong>functions</strong> in between.
          </p>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            <strong>OOP programming</strong> will be explained later. for now we must know that OOP in JS is <strong>prototype-based</strong>. it means objects inherit <strong>methods</strong> from a prototype-based object and that prototyped object is like a <strong>blueprint</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            <strong>Functional programming</strong> will be explained later.

        <div class="article__text-box u-margin-btm-lrg">
          <h2 class="heading-secondary--topics u-margin-btm-sml">first-class functions</h2>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            In a language with <strong>first-class functions</strong>,functions are simply <strong>treated as variables</strong>. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article__text-box u-margin-btm-lrg">
          <h2 class="heading-secondary--topics u-margin-btm-sml">Dynamic-typed</h2>
          <p class="u-margin-btm-sml">
            In JavaScript we don' define the data type. types becomes known at <strong>runtime</strong>. and also type of variables automatically changes whenever we assign it a different data type.
